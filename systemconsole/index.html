                  <h1>System Console</h1>
                
                <p>The system console gives you a direct way to interact with Tabletop Simulator's settings.  It can be used to automate repetitive actions, and customise your TTS experience.</p>
<h2 id="controls">Controls<a class="headerlink" href="#controls" title="Permanent link"> </a></h2>
<p>The console accepts basic text input.  Additionally, you may hit <code class="codehilite">up arrow</code> and <code class="codehilite">down arrow</code> to cycle back and forth through the command history, and <code class="codehilite">tab</code> to autocomplete your current command (if more than one command is possible from your current prefix then hit it a couple of times to list all matching commands).  Hitting the <code class="codehilite">`</code> key will activate the console.  Hitting it again will type the character; if you would rather it deactivated the console input as well as activating it, then you can make it do that by entering this command: <code class="codehilite">+console_hotkey_lock</code></p>
<h2 id="commands-variables">Commands &amp; Variables<a class="headerlink" href="#commands-variables" title="Permanent link"> </a></h2>
<p>You interact with the system console by typing commands into it.  When you hit enter the command will be perform its action, and then output its results to the console.</p>
<p>There is a subset of the commands which have an additional property; these are called <code class="codehilite">variables</code>, and each one stores a value (in addition to behaving like regular commands).  Typically these are used for the settings which govern TTS behaviour.  For example, the <code class="codehilite">color</code> command is a variable; it holds the seat color you currently occupy.  Typing it without any parameters will make it output its current value, while typing it with a parameter will let you set it; you could type <code class="codehilite">color red</code> to switch to the red seat, for instance.  You may also create your own variables with the <code class="codehilite">store_number</code>, <code class="codehilite">store_toggle</code>, and <code class="codehilite">store_text</code> commands; these are especially useful when writing scripts.</p>
<p>A lot of variables are toggles: they can be either <code class="codehilite">OFF</code> or <code class="codehilite">ON</code>.  For these you can set them in an additional way; by prefixing with <code class="codehilite">+</code>, <code class="codehilite">-</code>, or <code class="codehilite">!</code>.  <code class="codehilite">+</code> will turn it on, <code class="codehilite">-</code> will turn it off, and <code class="codehilite">!</code> will toggle it, changing it to the opposite of its current value.  For example: <code class="codehilite">+measure_in_metric</code> will set <code class="codehilite">measure_in_metric</code> to <code class="codehilite">ON</code>, and <code class="codehilite"><span class="sx">!measure_logging</span></code> when <code class="codehilite">measure_logging</code> is <code class="codehilite">ON</code> will set it to <code class="codehilite">OFF</code> (and vice-versa).</p>
<p>Note that some variables are <code class="codehilite">persistent</code> - this means that they will remember their value even after you close the game.</p>
<p>There are three commands which are extremely valuable when getting to know the console, these are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code class="codehilite">commands</code> - Lists all non-variable commands.</li>
<li><code class="codehilite">variables</code> - Lists all variable commands and their current values.</li>
<li><code class="codehilite">help</code> - Lists all commands, with a description of what they do.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may specify a prefix when using these to have them filter to only commands which begin with it; for example you could type <code class="codehilite">variables spectator</code> to see the value of all commands which deal with the spectator window.
Additionally, if you ask for <code class="codehilite">help</code> on a specific command it will give you a detailed description of how to use it.</p>
<p>You may insert variables into commands by enclosing them in <code class="codehilite">&lt;&lt;</code> and <code class="codehilite">&gt;&gt;</code>.  For example, typing <code class="codehilite">hovered</code> will display the GUID of the object your pointer is hovering over; <code class="codehilite">spectator_camera_target &lt;&lt;hovered&gt;&gt;</code> will set the spectator camera target with it.</p>
<p>If you start a command with the <code class="codehilite">@</code> symbol then it will be silenced; it will not output anything to the console.</p>
<h2 id="scripts">Scripts<a class="headerlink" href="#scripts" title="Permanent link"> </a></h2>
<p>The <code class="codehilite">exec</code> command will execute a series of commands separated either by <code class="codehilite">;</code> or by being on seperate lines.  Alternatively, you may use the <code class="codehilite">-v</code> parameter to execute a text variable as a script.  For example, <code class="codehilite">exec -v bootexec</code> will execute the commands in the <code class="codehilite">bootexec</code> variable.  You may also pass <code class="codehilite">exec</code> a <code class="codehilite">-q</code> parameter to make it execute in quiet mode (commands being executed are not echoed to the console, but their output is).</p>
<p>There are two special variables: <code class="codehilite">autoexec</code> and <code class="codehilite">bootexec</code>; these are text variables which load the contents of those two files - <code class="codehilite">autoexec.cfg</code> and <code class="codehilite">bootexec.cfg</code>, respectively - in your TTS user folder (<code class="codehilite">C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\Documents\My Games\Tabletop Simulator</code>).</p>
<p><code class="codehilite">autoexec</code> will be executed every time you start a game within TTS, while <code class="codehilite">bootexec</code> is only executed once, when TTS first starts up.  Note that the game resets every time you go back to the main menu, so if you want to affect any settings / add bindings / etc you need to do it in <code class="codehilite">autoexec</code></p>
<p>Example <code class="codehilite">bootexec</code>:
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># Host a game for 8 players using default server name and password</span>
host_game <span class="m">8</span>

<span class="c1"># Load game on row 4 slot 5</span>

<span class="c1"># Switch to system console</span>

<span class="c1"># Activate spectator window</span>

</pre></div></p>
<p>Example <code class="codehilite">autoexec</code>:
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># Make easier to type versions of spectator_camera_ commands.</span>
<span class="c1"># i.e. cam_load instead of spectator_camera_load</span>

<h3 id="special-characters">Special characters<a class="headerlink" href="#special-characters" title="Permanent link"> </a></h3>
<ul>
<li><code class="codehilite">@</code> - Behaves as it does normally; prefix it to a command to silence that command.</li>
<li><code class="codehilite">@@</code> - Two <code class="codehilite">@</code> in a row silences the remainder of the script; each command will behave as if it had a <code class="codehilite">@</code> before it.  <code class="codehilite">@@</code> again will disable this effect.</li>
<li><code class="codehilite">#</code> - At the start of a line is used for comments; the line will be ignored.</li>
<li><code class="codehilite">:</code> - At the start of a line is used to specify a label, which may be skipped to with the <code class="codehilite">skip</code> command.</li>
<li><code class="codehilite">&lt;</code> and <code class="codehilite">&gt;</code> - These will be expanded by <code class="codehilite">exec</code> into <code class="codehilite">&lt;&lt;</code> and <code class="codehilite">&gt;&gt;</code>; this is so that you can set up aliases and bindings which refer to variables, without them being replaced at the point the script executes.  To suppress this behaviour, start the line with <code class="codehilite">&gt;</code>.  You can see this used in the above <code class="codehilite">autoexec</code> in order to insert the <code class="codehilite">hovered</code> variable.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code class="codehilite">skip</code> command can be used inside a script to jump forward to a label.  It may not be used to jump backwards.  You may give it an optional <code class="codehilite">variable</code> and then further optional <code class="codehilite">comparison</code> and <code class="codehilite">value</code> parameters: if you do it will only skip if the variable is non-zero, or the result of the comparison is true.</p>
<p>Finally, the <code class="codehilite">exit</code> command will cause the script to stop executing.</p>
<p>Example <code class="codehilite">autoexec</code>:
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>@@ <span class="c1"># silence script</span>


<span class="c1">## Set up a `private_room` variable to govern whether server is private or public</span>

<h2 id="some-useful-commands">Some useful commands<a class="headerlink" href="#some-useful-commands" title="Permanent link"> </a></h2>
<p>As noted above, <code class="codehilite">help</code>, <code class="codehilite">commands</code>, and <code class="codehilite">variables</code> will let you find out everything you can do with the system console.  Having said that, here is a selection of some of the more useful commands available:</p>
<ul>
<li><code class="codehilite">add</code>, <code class="codehilite">subtract</code>, and <code class="codehilite">multiply</code> will let you do simple arithmetic on a variable.  <code class="codehilite">add</code> is useful for cycling a modal variable (it has an optional third parameter which sets a modulus), while <code class="codehilite">subtract</code> subtracts the variable <em>from</em> the value, so is useful for ping-ponging between two numbers.</li>
<li><code class="codehilite">alias</code> will create a new name for another command, while retaining any parameters you type in. Good for making shorter names for commands you use a lot.  Use with <code class="codehilite">store_text</code> and <code class="codehilite">exec</code> to make your own commands from scripts.  Can also be used to attach commands to each value of a toggle variable, which will run when the variable is set to that value.  Finally, if there are a bunch of commands which share a prefix which you want to make short versions of you can use <code class="codehilite">*</code> to do so (e.g. <code class="codehilite">alias cam_* spectator_camera_*</code>)</li>
<li><code class="codehilite">bind</code>, <code class="codehilite">unbind</code> control attaching commands to keypresses.  You may use <code class="codehilite">+</code> and <code class="codehilite">-</code> before the keycode to specify if you want it to trigger on <em>press</em> or <em>release</em>, respectively. <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/KeyCode.html">(list of Unity keycodes)</a></li>
<li><code class="codehilite">broadcast</code> will broadcast the provided message.</li>
<li><code class="codehilite">chat_font_size</code> sets the size of the font in the chat / console window.</li>
<li><code class="codehilite">clear</code> will clear a text variable.</li>
<li><code class="codehilite">color</code> reports/sets your player color.</li>
<li><code class="codehilite">console_hotkey_lock</code> When enabled, locks whichever key is bound to toggling the system console, so that hitting it always toggles the console (this makes the key untypeable in text input boxes).</li>
<li><code class="codehilite">default_host_name</code> and <code class="codehilite">default_password</code> set those values.</li>
<li><code class="codehilite">dice_roll_height_multiplier</code> sets how high dice go when randomized.</li>
<li><code class="codehilite">displays</code> outputs information on currently connected monitors.</li>
<li><code class="codehilite">drawing_erase_all</code> erases all drawings.</li>
<li><code class="codehilite">drawing_render_fully_visible</code> will cause drawings to render fully in 3d space (which is neat if you have VR)</li>
<li><code class="codehilite">echo</code> displays its parameters in the system console.</li>
<li><code class="codehilite">edit</code> allow you to edit a text variable with the in-game GUI (you may also do this by passing the variable the <code class="codehilite">-e</code> parameter, e.g. <code class="codehilite">autoexec -e</code>)</li>
<li><code class="codehilite">escape</code> will display a text variable in the console, and will  escape all the formatting characters (i.e. all the <code class="codehilite">[</code> and <code class="codehilite">]</code> characters).</li>
<li><code class="codehilite">find</code> finds a component on the table.</li>
<li><code class="codehilite">grabbed</code>, <code class="codehilite">hovered</code> output the GUID of the component you are interacting with.</li>
<li><code class="codehilite">highlight</code> a component.</li>
<li><code class="codehilite">host_game</code> creates a table; you can specify single player, multiplayer, or hotseat.</li>
<li><code class="codehilite">host_name</code> and <code class="codehilite">host_password</code> set those values for current game.</li>
<li><code class="codehilite">last</code> is a special variable which holds the value returned from the most recent command.</li>
<li><code class="codehilite">mirror_all</code> will mirror all text displayed in every other chat tab into the system console.  This means you can always be in the system console without missing any messages.</li>
<li><code class="codehilite">quiet_mode</code> will, when enabled, stop command names being echoed in the console.  Unlike silencing commands with <code class="codehilite">@</code>, this will still display the commands' output.</li>
<li><code class="codehilite">reset</code> will reset a persistent variable to its default value.</li>
<li><code class="codehilite">sendkey</code> will emulate a keypress.  Primarily useful for binding things to VR controllers.</li>
<li><code class="codehilite">status</code> will display some key information about the current game. </li>
<li><code class="codehilite">stats_monitor</code> will display some graphs/info which update in real time.</li>
<li><code class="codehilite">team</code> reports/sets your team.</li>
<li><code class="codehilite">ui_button</code> will add a button to the screen which performs a command when clicked.</li>
<li><code class="codehilite">ui_dialog_input</code> will display the text entry UI, and store the typed text in <code class="codehilite">last</code>.</li>
<li><code class="codehilite">ui_games_click</code> will click on a button on the game select UI, if it is open.  </li>
<li><code class="codehilite">ui_games_hide</code> will hide the game select UI without clicking on anything.</li>
<li><code class="codehilite">wait</code> is a command which can be inserted into a script to cause it to pause for some amount of time.  Useful for fudging a script to work with asynchronous commands which take some time to execute.</li>
</ul>
<p>Commands are named with their topic first, so commands which affect the same part of the game have the same prefix.  The following are some useful groups of commands: get more info on them by running <code class="codehilite">help prefix_</code>.  For instance, <code class="codehilite">help camera_</code></p>
<ul>
<li><code class="codehilite">camera_</code> commands control the position and behaviour of the player camera (i.e. your point-of-view)</li>
<li><code class="codehilite">chat_</code> commands control the chat window.</li>
<li><code class="codehilite">component_</code> commands deal with the game components on the table.  Notably the <code class="codehilite">component_default_</code> commands let you specify what toggles new component are created with, which is useful if you are creating a lot of similar components.</li>
<li><code class="codehilite">errors_</code> commands handle how Lua errors are displayed.</li>
<li><code class="codehilite">jigsaw_</code> commands let you mess with jigsaws.</li>
<li><code class="codehilite">log_</code> commands control formatting of lua <code class="codehilite">log</code> calls.</li>
<li><code class="codehilite">mirror_</code> commands govern mirroring text from other tabs into the system console.</li>

<li><code class="codehilite">spectator_</code> commands control the spectator view.</li>
<li><code class="codehilite">timestamp_</code> commands let you add timestamps to the chat channels / console.</li>
<li><code class="codehilite">tool_</code> commands let you check and set the currently used tool (grab, draw, etc).</li>
<li><code class="codehilite">ui_</code> commands deal with the game's User Interface.</li>
<li><code class="codehilite">vr_</code> commands perform all VR related tasks.</li>

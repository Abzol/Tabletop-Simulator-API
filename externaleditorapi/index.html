                <p>This page describes how our <a href="../atom">Official Atom Plugin</a> API works so that you can write your own plugin for your text editor of choice if Atom does not suit your needs. The plugin communicates with Tabletop Simulator via two localhost TCP connections - one for each system acting as a server and the other as a client and vice versa. All communication messages are JSON.</p>

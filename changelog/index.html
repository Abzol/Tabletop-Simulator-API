<ul>
<li>Lua:<ul>
<li>putObject() now returns an Object.<ul>
<li>Using it to combine two cards will return an object reference to the newly formed deck</li>
<li>Using it to put an object into a container/stack/deck will return the container/stack/deck it was made part of</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>New class: <strong>Notes</strong><ul>
<li>Contains notebook and set/getNotes functions</li>
<li>Devalued the old "Base" versions of these functions<ul>
<li><span class="critic comment">This means they are not in the documentation but will, for legacy reasons, still function.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>New class: <strong>Wait</strong><ul>
<li>This new class allows you to easily trigger functions after some form of delay</li>
<li>Contains frames, time, condition, and stop functions</li>
<li>Devalued Timer class entirely<ul>
<li><span class="critic comment">This means Timer is removed from documentation but, for legacy reasons, still functions.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>New Object functions:<ul>
<li><strong>obj.cut(int)</strong> - Cuts a deck at the given card index</li>
<li><strong>obj.split(int)</strong> - Splits a deck in a number of stacks</li>
<li><strong>obj.getRotationValue</strong> - Returns the current rotationValue of an object (see: gizmo tool)<ul>
<li>This function existed previously, but was not documented.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>New Event functions:<ul>
<li><strong>onObjectPeeked(player, object)</strong> - Triggers when peek is used by a player</li>

<li><strong>onRandomize(player)</strong> - Triggers when randomize (R) is used on an object.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Player Color strings convert automatically<ul>
<li>Example: printToAll("Hello", "Green")</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Snap points created on objects use Vectors local to the Object, rather than global<ul>
<li>This applies to both position and rotation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fix for optional parameters of spawnObjectJSON()</li>
<li>New Object Member Variables<ul>
<li>loading_custom - Indicates if the assets of a custom element are being loaded.</li>
<li>spawning - Indicates if any object is currently in the process of spawning.<ul>
<li>These are helpful to determine if elements are loaded into the game fully</li>
<li>Especially useful with the new Wait class!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Callback Changes<ul>
<li>Callback methods are being devalued (still work, but not documented)</li>
<li>Being replaced with callback_function which directly triggers a function at the same time a callback would have been triggered.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Custom UI:<ul>
<li>New Lua function:<ul>
<li><strong>UI.setValue(string id, string value)</strong> - Updates the value that appears within element tags <span class="critic comment">(ex: &lt;Text&gt;THIS&lt;/Text&gt;)</span></li>
<li><strong>UI.getValue(string id)</strong> - Obtains the value that appears within element tags <span class="critic comment">(ex: &lt;Text&gt;THIS&lt;/Text&gt;)</span></li>
<li>Both support Rich Text!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>New InputField attribute<ul>

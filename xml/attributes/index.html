                <p>As mentioned in the <a href="../xml/introUI">Introduction</a>, attributes are modifiers that can be applied to elements. They can be applied to individual elements or to whole groups of them.</p>
<div class="admonition important">
<p class="admonition-title">Important</p>
<p>They consists of two parts, a <strong>tag</strong> and a <strong>value</strong>. <strong><em>The value is always in quotation marks.</em></strong></p>
</div>
<h2 id="attribute-types">Attribute types<a class="headerlink" href="#attribute-types" title="Permanent link"> </a></h2>
<p>For XML, most of the attribute types are self-explanatory, like string or float (See Lua Scripting section for details on those). However XML has some unique types.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>color</strong><ul>
<li><strong>HTML 6 Char Hex</strong>: <code class="codehilite">#FFFFFF</code> <span class="critic comment">(white 100% opacity)</span></li>
<li><strong>8 Char Hex</strong>: <code class="codehilite">#FFFFFFCC</code> <span class="critic comment">(white 80% opacity)</span></li>
<li><strong>RGB Color</strong>: <code class="codehilite">rgb(1,1,1)</code> <span class="critic comment">(white 100% opacity)</span></li>
<li><strong>RGBA Color</strong>: <code class="codehilite">rgba(1,1,1,0.8)</code> <span class="critic comment">(white 80% opacity)</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>colorblock</strong><ul>
<li>Color block values are used to specify the colors for elements such as buttons and input fields.</li>
<li>Format: <strong>(normalColor|highlightedColor|pressedColor|disabledColor)</strong> where each color is formatted as above, e.g. <code class="codehilite">#FFFFFF|#FFFFFF|#C8C8C8|rgba(0.78,0.78,0.78,0.5)</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>bool</strong><ul>
<li><strong>True</strong>: <code class="codehilite">1</code> or <code class="codehilite">true</code></li>
<li><strong>False</strong>: <code class="codehilite">0</code> or <code class="codehilite">false</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>RectOffset</strong><ul>
<li>Padding accepts multiple padding values<ul>
<li><strong>left/right/top/bottom</strong>: Example: <code class="codehilite">5, 5, 10, 10</code></li>
<li><strong>all sides</strong>: Example: <code class="codehilite">10</code></li>

<h3 id="defaults">Defaults<a class="headerlink" href="#defaults" title="Permanent link"> </a></h3>
<p>The defaults Tag allows you to set default values for UI elements. Primarily this will be used to set styles and the like, but there is no restriction on what default values you can set.</p>
<p>Defaults can be applied to all instances of a particular tag type, or only those of a particular class (as set by the class attribute). Please note that elements may use more than one class (separated by spaces).</p>
<p>As with its HTML counterpart (CSS), XmlLayout Defaults are applied in a cascading fashion. This means that an element will always use the most recent value for an attribute - for example, if an element implements a class, it will use the attribute values defined by that class except when the element itself also defines those attributes (attributes defined on the element will always take precedence).</p>
<p>Defaults tags can be placed anywhere in the Xml document, but will only apply to elements after it.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">&lt;Defaults&gt;</span>
    <span class="c">&lt;!-- Set the default color and font size for all Text elements --&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;Text</span> <span class="na">color=</span><span class="s">&quot;#DDDDDD&quot;</span> <span class="na">fontSize=</span><span class="s">&quot;16&quot;</span> <span class="nt">/&gt;</span>

    <span class="c">&lt;!-- Set the default color for all Text elements using the &#39;darker&#39; class --&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;Text</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;darker&quot;</span> <span class="na">color=</span><span class="s">&quot;#AAAAAA&quot;</span> <span class="nt">/&gt;</span>

    <span class="c">&lt;!-- Set the default background image for all Button images --&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;Button</span> <span class="na">image=</span><span class="s">&quot;Sprites/Layout/Button&quot;</span> <span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/Defaults&gt;</span>
